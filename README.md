# ROI selection and Cell Counter


The study of cells in neurological research is pivotal for understanding their dynamic roles in brain health and disease. However, manual analysis of microscopic images can be tedious and subject to human error. To overcome these challenges, this project focuses on developing an automated system for selecting Regions of Interest (ROIs) and performing cell counting, akin to a digital cell counter and ROI selector.


The project involves the development of algorithms utilizing image processing techniques to automatically identify ROIs containing microglia cells within microscopic images. These algorithms require de manual delineating of the ROIs to subsequently, by preprocessing techniques, enhance image quality and optimize cell counting accuracy.


 The system effectively isolates areas of interest containing cells while minimizing background noise. Moreover, image preprocessing techniques have improved image clarity, facilitating more precise cell counting.
